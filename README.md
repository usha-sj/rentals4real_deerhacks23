## Introducing R4R

Rentals 4 Real is a platform that automates the housing rental search process.

## My Role: UX/UI Design

[Here]([https://www.google.com](https://www.figma.com/file/3iS4q3rLpHEudUNikr02sF/deerhacks---real4real?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&t=XeVKSujHyHpCbL5Q-1)) is the Figma file.


My role as part of the team working on the front-end of the project, was to design and build the foundation of the website's structure and layout. I used Figma to create a basic mock-up design to then be coded using HTML, JS and CSS. Furthermore, the README, submission video and logo were all created by me.

## Inspiration

We were inspired to create R4R based off our personal experiences and frustrations while searching for off-campus housing as university students.

## How To Use

## How It Works

We are using FastAPI's web framework to create a REST API. The API is connected to a MongoDB database, which stores all the data. The API is hosted on Heroku, and the database is hosted on MongoDB Atlas. The frontend is built using React, and is hosted on Netlify. The frontend is connected to the API using the native fetch API.

### Rest API
